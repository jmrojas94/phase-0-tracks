2) You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

sqlite> SELECT reviews.id, reviews.stars, reviews.comment, reviews.business_id, businesses.name, reviews.user_id, users.first_name, users.last_name FROM reviews JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id JOIN users on reviews.user_id = users.id;
1|3|This place was decent|3|The Beagle Nightclub|1|Bradford|Pitt
2|2|Horrible pricing|2|Amir's Towing|2|Mandy|Kaling
3|5|Married Bradford Pitt here|1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|3|Angela|Jolie


3) There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

sqlite> SELECT reviews.stars, reviews.comment, businesses.name, users.first_name, users.last_name FROM reviews JOIN businesses on reviews.business_id = businesses.id JOIN users on reviews.user_id = users.id;

4) How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 
sqlite> SELECT reviews.id, reviews.stars, reviews.comment, reviews.business_id, businesses.name, reviews.user_id, users.first_name, users.last_name FROM reviews JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id JOIN users on reviews.user_id = users.id WHERE businesses.name="The Beagle Nightclub";

# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control? 
Version control keeps versions of changes made to a file and keeps it organized. Why is it useful? It is useful because it helps you keep track of changes made and lets you test different versions for bugs before merging into the master branch.
* What is a branch and why would you use one? 
A branch is a copy of a project and you would use a branch so you can edit a project to keep the master branch from being ruined.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? 
A commit is a save point in a git project and a good commit message is one that is clear, present tense and gets the point across.
* What is a merge conflict? 
When your current branch has commits that are not in the master branch.
